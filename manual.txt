Don't share it for the moment!

* The multiplayer is disabled on purpose.
* The loading time at the beginning is only for the OGG... I need to multithread this part.
* The game is very unbalanced now... It is just an alpha version.
* My best lvl is 15 (after testing it for 10min)

- Only 1 map with a long road

- You can add spells directly to the tower
- No player skill limits (You can choose any spell/tower you want)

Keys :
- Holding <Shift> : Allow to construct many towers without selecting it between each construction (really useful)
- <F1>  : FullScreen
- <F2>  : Show Grid
- <F5>  : Reload Shaders
- <F6>  : Reload Colors
- <F7>  : Change the player (to simulate Multiplayer mode, !disabled!)
- <F10> : MAIN MENU

- <Page Up>   : Zoom +
- <Page Down> : Zoom -

Shortcuts for towers are automatically based on the first letter of the tower :
- <A> : Arrow Tower
- <S> : Stone Tower (canon)
- <L> : Laser Tower
- <M> : Missile Tower

"Fire" : Damage over the time
"Ice"  : Slow the unit
"Light": Increase the visibility
"Earth": Stun the unit
"Poison": Reduce the armor

To evoluate a tower : click on a tower and choose the evolution
Canon Tower cannot use spells except if the spell is AOE (there is none atm)

There is no End to the game right now :p
But you can fill the files to increase the content (tell me if you do and balance the game): 
 - "spells.txt" : All the effects
 - "towers.txt" : All the towers
 - "ammo.txt" : Ammo linked to the towers. Many towers can have the same ammo.
 - "unit.txt" : All the unit used by the party (will be load depending of the map later)
 
 
 Enjoy the game !
